            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Let the paint work. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be.
